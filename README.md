## About this project

With the idea of showing off my skills, I have created a repository to list all of the ways I have designed infrastructures that run my portfolio using different IaC and cloud resources.

You can find that repository here: https://github.com/christian-deleon/portfolio-iac

The this portfolio was designed and developed by me using React.Js, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
